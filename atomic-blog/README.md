# Atomic Blog

The **Atomic Blog** is a dynamic React application that allows users to manage a list of "atomic posts". The app includes features like creating, searching, and managing posts, toggling between light and dark modes, and displaying archived posts from a large post archive.

## Features

- ðŸŒ™ **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes using a button.
- ðŸ“œ **Search Functionality**: Search through the posts by title or body.
- ðŸ“¦ **Post Management**: Add new posts or clear all current posts.
- ðŸ“‚ **Archive**: View a large archive of 10,000 posts and add them as new posts.

## Technologies Used
